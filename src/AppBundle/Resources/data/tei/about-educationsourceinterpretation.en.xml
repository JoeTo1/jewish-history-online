                <head>What is a source?</head>
                <lb/>
                <p>Everything that tells us something about the past can be used as a source. These
                    can be texts, pictures, objects, films, radio broadcasts, etc.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>A distinction can be made between sources that have already been written for
                    posterity (e. g. memoirs) and sources that have been handed down by chance (e.
                    g. everyday objects). The former are referred to as tradition and the latter as
                    remnants.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p>Not every type of source is suitable for every thematic aspect / period. When
                    working with and the source the specific characteristics of the source genre
                    should always be

                    into account , the critical analysis of a movie differs from working with an
                    early modern manuscript; different abilities and skills are required in each
                    case.</p>

                <head>How do I work with a source?</head>
                <lb/>
                <p>Various questions can be addressed to sources. Even if not all these questions
                    can be answered, the goal is to find out as much information as possible. To
                    this end, the source itself is consulted, furthermore other sources and
                    secondary literature are also used to supplement and contextualize the
                    information contained in the source.</p>
                <lb/>
                <p> First of all, we need to clarify what kind of source it is: <list>
                        <item>Text, image, object…?</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>Official report, newspaper article, ego document…?</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>Place of deposit</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>Condition and transmission: Original or copy?</item>
                        <lb/>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p> Then the source must be read / looked at / heard and understood. This includes,
                    for example, clarifying unknown foreign words or terms unknown today /
                    historical terms or contexts. </p>
                <lb/>
                <p>The next step deals with the context from which it originated, for example: <list>
                        <item>Author, his or her background (personal, family, professional) and his
                            or her intentions</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>Date of origin</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>Addressees / recipients / distribution</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>Historical context</item>
                        <lb/>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <lb/>
                <p> Finally, emphasis is layed on the content of the source: <list>
                        <item>What does it deal with? </item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>What is mentioned, what is concealed?</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>What stands between the lines?</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>Are there references to contemporary events, people etc.?</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>Are there any indications of counterfeiting or subsequent
                            changes?</item>
                        <lb/>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p> After the source has been examined and analyzed in detail, the question arises
                    as to its significance for one's own question: <list>
                        <item>What benefits does the source provide for me?</item>
                        <lb/>
                        <item>What does it tell you,

                        <item>What conclusions can be drawn from this for my further inquiries /
                            research?</item>
                        <lb/>
                    </list>
